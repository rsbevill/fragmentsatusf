### Medieval Manuscript Fragments at USF

This site is a proof-of-concept mockup of a digital exhibition on medieval manuscript fragments housed in USF Libraries Special Collections. I've included a sample set of images from different items in the collection (this equates to about half the total manuscripts that would need to be digitized) with a few sample metadata fields to demonstrate the searching and browsing capabilities of a Wax-built digital library. I've also included a sample exhibition page to demonstrate how this site allows for multiple layouts, using images from the collection. For more information about Wax, check the links and credits in the footer. To access the github for this site and view the file and folder structure, follow [this link](https://github.com/rsbevill/fragmentsatusf).
