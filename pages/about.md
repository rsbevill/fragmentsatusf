### What is Fragmentology? 
The study of medieval manuscript fragments (fragmentology) covers an important gap within the larger field of manuscript studies. In the opening editorial of the first issue of Fragmentology, an open-access peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of fragments, Bill Duba and Christoph Flüeler address the distinction between studying fragments and studying manuscripts with an expansive definition of the problems they present: "Fragments not only relate to the whole they originally belonged to, but also to a whole that the history of fragmentation created."[^1] Fragments cannot be studied through simply a set of paleographical or codicological questions--even book history alone is insufficient. Fragmentology requires a combination of all of the above with the added interests of other humanities fields: the institutional histories that shaped the collections holding the fragments, the literary value of their textual contents, the musical and religious value of the liturgies on their pages, and the value of possessing and accessing artifacts of the past for the purposes of pedagogy.

### Why is it important to apply the study of Fragmentology to USF's Collections?
The Directory of Institutions in the United States and Canada with Pre-1600 Manuscript Holdings, updated in 2014 by Melissa Conway and Lisa Fagin Davis, includes this report on the manuscript holdings in USF's special collections: "As of 6 November 2005, this collection reported holdings of 12 codices and approximately 14 leaves."[^2] In 2019, that number is strikingly different. From what I've been able to find, USF currently holds approximately 25 individual leaves, one bound gathering of about 8 leaves of Vincent of Beauvais' Speculum Historiale, and a single full fifteenth-century codex. Why is there such a discrepancy in numbers? The answer(s) lie in the nature of how medieval manuscript fragments come to exist within the collections of university libraries.

Initially curated as parts of teaching collections, purchased (or loaned or donated) from private collectors, or acquired from auctions and booksellers, the fragments of medieval manuscripts--often books of hours or music texts from the 14th and 15th centuries--are a small, but persistent part of the university library special collections landscape. This proposed digital exhibition hopes to explore the contexts surrounding the collection of medieval manuscript fragments present at USF, a relatively young institution with a nevertheless complicated history of manuscript provenance. By digitizing, transcribing, and annotating the individual manuscript leaves, this digital exhibition will make these manuscripts more accessible for teaching and research. By also providing academic context on the provenance of the fragments, connecting them with other pages from the same original codices, and exploring the book-breaking practices of early 20th century biblioclasts like Otto Ege and his more recent contemporaries, this digital exhibition will also provide a much-needed academic case-study on the nature of fragmentary manuscript collections and will contribute to the ongoing academic discussions in the fields of manuscript studies and fragmentology.

### What questions in this field can a digital exhibition answer?
This project, with its tight focus on the manuscript fragments held at a single institution, will need to be cognizant of the questions that drive each field. 

* What is the provenance of these fragments? Can they be identified, dated, and localized by paleographical methodology? How were they fragmented from their original codex? By whom and for what purpose? 
* Why did USF Libraries make the decision to acquire these fragments? If they were purchased, when? And for what purpose? If they were donated, how did that donation come to happen? What is the story behind the discrepancy of numbers between 2005 and the present-day? How does USF's institutional history tell us more about the nature of this collection?
* How can we read these documents? What do students need to know about understanding medieval pages from Books of Hours, Missals, Antiphonals, Charters, Histories, and Psalters? Which digital tools can we use to best transform the digitized avatars of these fragments into effective teaching tools?
* As these are fragments of original texts, can we connect them back to the larger world of digital fragmentology? Can our holdings assist with the efforts of other researchers to reconstruct fragmented medieval manuscript codices?
* Where does this small collection of medieval material fit within the larger holdings of USF libraries (which include strong collections of Cuban-American documents, science fiction pulps, and Floridiana)?
* How are manuscripts usually broken into fragments and sold into independent or institutional collections? What are the ethical considerations of building a collection of manuscript fragments and how can USF contribute to the present-day conversations on this practice?
